In order to make it easier to move things around expanded folders, I'd like to allow drop after when targeting a folder that's expanded

However, currently this causes the visualization to show a prospective location that's at the top of the subgroups, which is confusing since the group will actually land under the subgroups.

However, if change it to drop _before_, then I can show the visualization above the info header and still don't have to worry about the size of the subgroup list in the CSS. That will still show things in the correct location.
