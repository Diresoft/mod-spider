# Mod Spider
> Focus on what you want, not what you need

## Intention
This tool is intended to aid in planning mod lists for various games. It's goal is to make it easier to plan a mod list based on only what the user *wants*, while leaving dependency and conflict handling to the tool. Once the user is ready to install, the dependencies will be presented as part of the step-by-step install guide

## Planned Features
- Internal mod database
  - Add mods from URL
  - Add mods manually
  - Add dependencies/conflicts automatically by scraping URL
  - Add install instructions
  - Mark complex conflicts and resolutions (i.e. per file)
  
- GUI based mod planning
  - Drag and drop mods from the database to your list
  - Manage list in groups
  - Highlight mods/groups with incompatibilities
  - Suggest patches when relevant mods are included in the list

- Automatically generate an install guide
  - Easily clickable links to downloads
  - Full instructions readily visible
  - Breakdown of install options
    - User can add pictures and screenshots

*Note: Currently, the focus of development is Bethesda RPGs such as Skyrim or Fallout 4 and their modding scene.*
